//You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
//Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
//Solution
var climbStairs = function(n) {

    let one = 1;
    let two = 2;
    let count = 0;
    if (n == 1 ){
        return 1;
    }
    
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++){
        count = one + two;
        one = two;
        two = count;
    }
    return two;
