//Description

//You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers.
//The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N.
//Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

// Solution 

function findOutlier(integers){
  
  let arry2 = [];
  let arry3 = [];  
  
  for (let i = 0; i < integers.length; i++){
       if (integers[i] % 2 == 0){
          arry2.push(integers[i])
      } else{
          arry3.push(integers[i])
      }       
    }
  
    if (arry2.length < arry3.length){
        return arry2[0];
    }else{
        return arry3[0];
    }    
}
